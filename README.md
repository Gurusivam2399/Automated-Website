# Automated-Website

LetCode is open source website to practise the Automation test. In this project i am using Java language to biuld the logics and Selenium WebDrivers in the testing.

JAVA:
     Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies.

SELENIUM:
      Selenium is an open-source, automated testing tool used to test web applications across various browsers. Selenium can only test web applications, unfortunately, so desktop and mobile apps can't be tested. However, other tools like Appium and HP's QTP can be used to test software and mobile applications.

TESTNG:
      TestNG provides advanced features such as annotations, data-driven testing, test sequencing, and parallel testing to help you organize and execute your Selenium tests more efficiently and effectively.
